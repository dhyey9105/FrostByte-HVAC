# ❄️ FrostByte: AI-Driven HVAC Controller
### Team FrostByte | AI Innovation Challenge 2026

## 📌 Project Overview
FrostByte is an intelligent HVAC controller designed for Indian MSMEs. It uses AI and IoT simulation to optimize chiller energy consumption based on:
1. Real-time Weather Data (OpenWeatherMap API)
2. Occupancy Levels (IoT Sensor Simulation)
3. Room Size Thermodynamics

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI Optimization:** Reduces energy load by 15-20% compared to standard chillers.
- **IoT Simulation:** Toggle-able "Sensor Mode" to simulate live occupancy detection.
- **Audit Reports:** Generates PDF sustainability reports automatically.
- **Chatbot:** "EcoBot" (Powered by Gemini) for energy advice.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py

## 👥 Team
- Dhyey J. Nathvani (Team Leader)
- Harsh D. Patel (Research Strategy)

## 📍 Note for Evaluators
The system is currently configured for the "Gandhinagar" region for the competition demo.
